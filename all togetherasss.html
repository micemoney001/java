  <!-- HISTROY OF JAVASCRIPT -->
  <h3 style="background-color: lime;">HISTROY OF JAVASCRIPT IN SHORT </h3>
  <div class="container" style="background-color: black; color: white; text-align: centerz;">
    <h4>ES1:</h4>
    <p> Released in June 1997, ES1 was the first standardized version of JavaScript.</p>
    <p>It introduced foundational features such as variables, functions, conditionals, and loops.</p>

    <h4>ES2 (ECMAScript 2):</h4>
    <p>- Released in June 1998, ES2 had minor updates and improvements, but no significant new features.</p>

    <h4>ES3 (ECMAScript 3): </h4>
    <p>- Released in December 1999, ES3 brought substantial improvements to JavaScript.</p>
    <p>- It introduced features like try/catch for error handling, regular expressions, and support for working with
      dates and arrays.</p>

    <h4>ES4 (ECMAScript 4): </h4>
    <p>- ES4 was initially planned to be the next major release, but due to disagreements in the community, it was
      abandoned. No unique features were introduced in this version.</p>

    <h4>ES5 (ECMAScript 5):</h4>
    <p>- Released in December 2009, ES5 added several important features.</p>
    <p>- It introduced strict mode for better error-checking, new array methods like forEach and map, and JSON support.
    </p>

    <h4>ES6 (ECMAScript 2015):</h4>
    <p>- Released in June 2015, ES6 was a significant milestone for JavaScript.</p>
    <p>- It introduced numerous new features like arrow functions, classes, template literals (using backtick quotes),
      destructuring assignments, and enhanced object literals.</p>
    <p>- ES6 also introduced modules for better code organization and introduced new iterations and generators for
      advanced looping and control flow.

      ES6 marked a shift in JavaScript's development, with subsequent yearly releases (ES2016, ES2017, etc.) bringing
      further enhancements and new features to the language.</p>

            <p style="background-color: blue; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; color:red ;">COMPARISON </p>
            (1.) Comparison operators are used to compare two values and evaluate whether they are equal, not equal,
            greater than, less than, etc.  Examples include "==" for equal to, "!=" for not equal to, ">" for greater
            than, "<" for less than. <br>
            (2.) They allow you to easily compare values and determine their relationships. <br>
           (3.)  They allow you to validate user input by comparing it with expected values. <br>
           (4.) Comparison operators are crucial in sorting and searching algorithms. <br>
            (5.) They enable you to perform mathematical operations by comparing values. <br>
            (6.) Comparison operators are essential in creating loops and iterating over data. <br>
           (7.) Comparison operators help in making decisions and controlling the flow of a program.

        <div class="col-md-6" style="background-color: blue; color: white; ">
            <p style="background-color: red; font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold; color: blue     ;">LOGICAL </p>
            Logical operators, on the other hand, are used to combine multiple conditions and evaluate them as a
            whole. Examples include "&&" for logical AND, "||" for logical OR, and "!" for logical NOT. <br>
            (2.) They help in creating complex decision-making processes by combining multiple criteria. <br>
            (3.) Logical operators enable you to control the flow of your program based on different conditions. <br>
            (4.) They provide a concise and efficient way to express compound conditions. <br>
            (5.)Logical operators are essential in creating loops and iterating over data based on specific conditions. <br>
            (6.)They help in filtering and organizing data by applying multiple criteria. <br>
            (7.) Logical operators are widely used in conditional statements like if-else and switch-case.
